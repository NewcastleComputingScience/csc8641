Reading list:

Mckinney's book - *Python for data analysis : Data wrangling with pandas, numpy, and ipython*:

- [Chapter 5](https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/44969/files/6456581?module_item_id=2613109)

  (Section 6.1, until page 175 excluding)

Again, it is important to write code as you read and learn about pandas. For this section, I
recommend running the code interactively in a Jupyter notebook where you can execute the code in
steps, append notes and save it for later.
