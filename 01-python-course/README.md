## About this course

This course's primary objective is to get you up to speed with base Python concepts and programming
skills required for CSC8641 - Big Data Analytics (taught in block 4, Semester 2). In addition to key
Python concepts, you will be introduced to the python ecosystem for data science, particularly Numpy
for numerical computing and Pandas for manipulation and analysis of tabular data.

This course is structured for self-learning, with new material being made available at the start of
each week. The coursework material is a compilation of content from different resources, primarily
textbooks. You are expected to work through the material at your own pace and complete the proposed
assessment challenges (selected programming exercises). Note, however, that these exercises **are
not marked**.
