# Preparation course for CSC8641 - Big Data Analytics

This is a short 4-week preparatory course for CSC8641 - Big Data Analytics.

| Course week | Timetable week | Date   | Theme                              |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 1           | 11             | 21 Nov | Python Intro                       |
| 2           | 12             | 28 Nov | Programming with Jupyter notebooks |
| 3           | 13             | 05 Dec | Lazy evaluation and Numpy          |
| 4           | 14             | 12 Dec | Data manipulation with Pandas      |


The course's primary objective is getting students up to speed with key Python concepts and
programming skills, required for CSC8641 - Big Data Analytics, to be taught in Semester 2. In
addition to base Python concepts, students will be introduced to the python ecosystem for data
science, particularly Numpy for numerical computing and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

This course is structured for self-learning, with new material being made available at the start of
each week. The coursework material is a compilation of content from different resources, primarily
textbooks. Students are expected to work through the material at their own pace and complete the
proposed assessment challenges, which consist of curated programming exercises. However, note that this exercises **are not marked**. You may use GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/NewcastleComputingScience/csc8641/issues) or canvas' [discussions page](https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/44969/discussion_topics) to ask questions about the coursework and discuss any content/exercises as a group.
