# Week 1 - Intro to Python


## Part 1 - Environment Setup

Welcome to part 1 of this session, our goal is to setup Python so that we can get started with
coding and learning the basics.

Environment setup has traditionally been a major pain-point when it comes to getting started with
Python. Thankfully, nowadays there are tools that allow you to start writing code with just a few
clicks, regardless of which Operating System you are using. One of such tools, particularly popular
amongst data scientists, is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - an open-source [Python
distribution]((https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDistributions)) platform. Besides providing the
Python executable itself, Anaconda also includes other features that make it easier to build Python
projects and perform scientific research, particularly for users less accustomed to the
command-line:

- Anaconda Navigator
- 

In this section you will:

1. Install Anaconda (if using you're using your own computer)
2. Open Anaconda Navigator
3. Import our Anaconda environment
4. Load the environment using QtConsole

### Install Anaconda

- School computer - If you're on a school computer, then
- Personal computer - If you're using you're personal computer, download the [installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and follow the instructions on screen.

### Open Anaconda Navigator

Once Anaconda has been successfully installed, open Anaconda Navigator. It should look like this:

There are two main Navigator tabs you will primarily interact with:

- The **Home** tab, used to open Applications available within your Environment.
- The **Environment** tab, lists your python environments and allows you to create and import new environments, or modify existing environments (namely by installing a new package or application).

### Import our Anaconda environment

### Load the environment using QtConsole



## Part 2 - Getting started with Python

Welcome to part 2 of this session. Now that we have a python environment to work with, we will use
interactive python to explore several base python concepts:

- Numbers and arithmetic operators
- Variable declaration and syntax
- Input and output
- Strings
- Booleans and None
- Flow control: if-else statements, for loops
- Functions

You can choose to launch IPython on your system's default console, by pressing, or through Jupyter QtConsole (which is a more sophisticated IPython console).
