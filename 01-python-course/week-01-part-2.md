# Week 1 - Getting started with Python

Welcome to part 2 of this session. Now that you have a working Python environment, you will begin to
explore key python concepts, namely:

- Numbers and arithmetic operators
- Variable declaration and syntax
- Input and output
- Strings
- Booleans and None
- Flow control: if-else statements, for loops
- Functions

You can choose to launch IPython on your system's default console, by pressing, or through Jupyter QtConsole (which is a more sophisticated IPython console).
